Introducing a character that we simply refer to asâ€¦ da Bomb. Like many of the .gif animations available to share for free on mizioko, da Bomb will be a playable character in our future endless runner game. It may be a bit of a stretch but we do hope to release the mobile game by February of 2018. 

Look for coming page displaying the progress and animations for our first mobile game!


# Just Sayin BOO!

Page of Boo, hope to make a series of acceptably creepy Boos!
